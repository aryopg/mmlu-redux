III only\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length. The tension in the string is increased until a new set of standing waves is produced. Will the wavelength of the new standing waves be greater than or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves?\nA. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nB. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nC. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\nD. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\nAnswer:",

Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\nD.
