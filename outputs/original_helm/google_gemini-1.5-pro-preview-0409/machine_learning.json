Based on these results, what is the probability of side 3 coming up when using Add-1 Smoothing?\nA. 2.0/15\nB. 1.0/7\nC. 3.0/16\nD. 1.0/5\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: Which image data augmentation is most common for natural images?\nA. random crop and horizontal flip\nB. random crop and vertical flip\nC. posterization\nD. dithering\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: To achieve an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%), according to Hoeffding's inequality the IID test set must have how many examples?\nA. around 10 examples\nB. around 100 examples\nC. between 100 and 500 examples\nD. more than 1000 examples\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Statement 1| The derivative of the sigmoid $\\sigma(x)=(1+e^{-x})^{-1}$ with respect to $x$ is equal to $\\text{Var}(B)$ where $B\\sim \\text{Bern}(\\sigma(x))$ is a Bernoulli random variable. Statement 2| Setting the bias parameters in each layer of neural network to 0 changes the bias-variance trade-off such that the model's variance increases and the model's bias decreases\nA. True, True\nB. False, False\nC. True, False\nD. False, True\nAnswer:",
